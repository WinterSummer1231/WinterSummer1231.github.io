    <h1>Top 5 Places to Visit in ....<br>New Zealand!</h1>
    <p id="intro">For many travelers, New Zealand is both a dream destination and a once-in-a-lifetime place to visit. If you’re planning your first trip to New Zealand, or if you’re planning a return trip to see more of this beautiful and wild country, you may want to know which places in New Zealand are at the top of the must-see list. Here are our picks for the 5 best places to go in New Zealand.</p>           
    <h2 class="Headings">1. Bay of Islands</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Man_o%27war_cove_near_lulworth_dorset_arp.jpg/800px-Man_o%27war_cove_near_lulworth_dorset_arp.jpg" width="125">
    <p class="Paragraphs">The Bay of Islands is one of the best places to go in New Zealand for fishing, sailing, and other watersports. The Bay of Islands is about three hours by car from Auckland. This gorgeous region is made up of 144 islands between Cape Brett and the Purerua Peninsula.
What’s there to do in the Bay of Islands? Get on or in the water! Try scuba diving with Paihia Dive‘s intro-to-diving course. You will be ferried far out into the bay to explore a whole new underwater world.</p> 
    <h2 class="Headings">2. Milford Sound</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Emerald_Bay.jpg/1024px-Emerald_Bay.jpg" width="175">
    <p class="Paragraphs">Rudyard Kipling called Milford Sound the “eighth wonder of the world,” and if you visit this region of New Zealand, you’ll see why. Formed by glaciers during the Ice Age, the landscape around Milford Sound still bears evidence of its creation in the form of epic scenery: Cliffs rise from fjords crowned by mountains and waterfalls.
The best way to see Milford Sound is via boat. Take a sightseeing cruise on the fjord to see waterfalls and wildlife such as dolphins and penguins. Or navigate the waters under your own steam on a kayaking tour.
Once you’ve experienced the water from the surface, go underneath with a visit to the Milford Discovery Centre and Underwater Observatory. This is the only floating, underwater observatory in New Zealand, and visitors can go more than 30 feet deep (while staying dry) and get 360 degrees of the underwater environment.</p> 
    <h2 class="Headings">3. Auckland</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/New_Auckland_Infobox_Pic_Montage_2.jpg" width="200">
    <p class="Paragraphs"> As both the largest city in New Zealand and its international air-travel hub, Auckland is one of the best places to go in New Zealand. Many international flights arrive in New Zealand through Auckland Airport, which makes it an ideal city from which to start your exploration of New Zealand.
Spend at least a day or two in Auckland—named one of the top 10 cities in the world by Lonely Planet—before venturing further afield in New Zealand. Here are our suggestions for what to see and do in Auckland:
Get some culture by visiting one of the many museums in Auckland, such as the Auckland Art Gallery. The Auckland Art Gallery is the largest art institution in New Zealand, featuring more than 15,000 works of historic, modern, and contemporary art.
If the weather is nice, take a stroll through the 185-acre Auckland Domain park. If you’re visiting on a Saturday, include a stop at the nearby Parnell Farmers’ Market, which sells fresh produce in the morning. </p>
    <h2 class="Headings">4. Waiheke Island</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Vinepyrennees2.jpg" width="200">
    <p class="Paragraphs"> Just a little more than 30 minutes by boat from downtown Auckland is Waiheke Island, one of the best places to go in New Zealand for wine lovers. For a small island in the middle of Hauraki Gulf, Waiheke Island sure is home to a lot of vineyards. To sample as many of them as you can on your visit to Waiheke Island, you’ll want to find someone else to drive. Our pick is Waiheke Island Wine Tours, whose expert local guides will shuttle you around to three vineyards to sample 14 different wines. Of course, there’s more to do on Waiheke Island than just drink wine! Waiheke Island is also famous for its vibrant art community, beaches, forests, and olive groves. We recommend booking a culture tour, scenic flight, or hiking trip while you’re there to really see why Waiheke Island is one of the best places to go in New Zealand.</p>
    <h2 class="Headings">5. White Island</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/White_Island_cropped.jpg"  width="250">
    <p class="Paragraphs">White Island is the country’s most active volcano, which makes it one of the best places to go in New Zealand for adventurous travelers. Get up close and personal with White Island by taking a scenic helicopter ride with Volcanic Air Safaris. Your White Island tour won’t be a leisurely stroll: Because this is a very active volcano, you’ll have to wear a hard hat and gas mask. You may even see volcanologists monitoring the volcano. Although the volcano is commonly known as White Island, its full name is Te Puia o Whakaari, a Maori name that translates to “The Dramatic Volcano.” The island was first called White Island by Captain Cook in 1769 because every time he sailed near it, it appeared to be covered in a cloud of white steam. (Cook never realized it was a volcano.) If a helicopter tour of White Island is not your thing, there are a number of other ways to explore the volcano. You can take a boat to White Island or get a bird’s-eye view of it on a scenic flight. You can even go scuba diving around White Island for a look at the volcano’s underwater vents. </p>
